## Coding: TypeScript Type

In this task, the goal is to define the type "Student" in TypeScript. Each student should have a first name, last name, age, and a property "grades" that contains a list of grades. In this first step, a grade should be an integer from 1 to 6. Choose suitable English names for the attributes. Then create a student and output it in the console.

* Please work together, one of you should create a Vite project with TypeScript.
* Step 1: Write a function that outputs a student with their grades, where a student should be output with first name, last name, age, and a list of grades.

Highlight the output of the first and last names, age, and grades with a line of 30x "=".
Example:

```
Anton Meier (17)
==============================
Grades: 1,4,3,1,3,2,1,2
```

* Step 2: Allow strings and numbers as grades
  Task:

Ensure that besides grades as numbers (German system), values A to F (American system) are also supported as grades. The function should output the student's grades.

Example:
```
Anton Meier (17) 
==============================

 Noten:
A,2,F,3,1,B,2,5
```
* Step 3: Allow undefined as a value (displayed as *)
  Task:

Ensure that "undefined" is now supported as a value in the grades. The function should output the student's grades and represent "undefined" as "*". (For example, if the student was absent and not graded).

Example:
```
Anton Meier (17) 
===========================

 Noten:
A,2,*,3,1,B,*,5
```
* Step 4: Print a list of all students in the console
  Task:

Write a function that prints a list of all students in the console.

Example:
```
Anton Meier (16)
===========================
Grades: 1,4,3,1,A,*,1,2
```
```
Berta M체ller (17)
===========================
Grades: A,*,1
```

```
C채sar Schmidt (17)
==========================
Grades: A,1,*,3,2,4,5
```

## Bonus

Wow, you're fast! If you like, also work on this optional bonus task.

* Bonus:
  Task:

Write a function that highlights the names of the students with "=====". For each character in the entry, the same number of "=" characters should be used as needed for the name and age of the student.
Example:
```
Anton Meier (16)
===================
Grades: 1,4,3,1,A,*,1,2
```
```
Berta M체ller (17)
==================
Grades: A,*,1
```
```
C채sar Schmidt (17)
===============
Grades: A,1,*,3,2,4,5
```
* Bonus:
  Task:

Restructure the student and the transcript in such a way that grades can be assigned to specific subjects. Afterwards, the student should be formatted with the corresponding grades per subject.

```
Florian Weber (14)
 ==============

Noten: 
Sport: A,1,* 
Kunst: 3,2,4,5
Mathe: 1,2,A
```

*  Bonus average grade:
   Calculate the average grade for each student and later for the entire list of students. Discuss together how you want to design the calculation exactly (including handling undefined, weighting if one student has more grades than others, etc).

## Bonus

* Copy the response from the Rick&Morty API with the characters into a variable.
* Write a function that takes a list of Rick&Morty characters and returns a list of only the living humans.
* Write another function that takes a list of Rick&Morty characters and returns a list (of strings) with the names of the characters.
* Write another function that takes a list of Rick&Morty characters and returns a list of special objects. The objects should be structured as follows:
 ```
{
    "name": "some-name",
    "origin": "name-of-origin",
}
 ```
